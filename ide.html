    <h1><b>IDE'S</b></h1>
    <p> An integrated development environment is a software
         application that provides comprehensive facilities 
         to computer programmers for software development. 
         An IDE normally consists of at least a source code 
         editor, build automation tools and a debugger. </p> 
    
    <h2><b>PyCharm</b></h2>
    <img style="float: right;" src="https://www.rezourze.com/rz-storage/2020/09/PyCharm-Python-IDE.jpg" alt="pycharm logo" height="400px" width="500px" >
    <p>For different types of programming language, different IDES suits better.</p>
    <p>PyCharm is a hybrid platform developed by JetBrains as an IDE for Python. 
      It is commonly used for Python application development. Some of the unicorn organizations
      such as Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and Pinterest use PyCharm as their Python IDE!</p>
    <p>There are two versions: Professional and Community. The Community version is free
      and open-source and the Professional version is the paid one. You can choose any according
      to your requirements and then you can proceed with configuring PyCharm.

    <h3><b>Visual Code</b></h3>

    <p>Visual Studio Code (famously known as VS Code) is a free open source text editor by Microsoft. 
      VS Code is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Although the editor is relatively lightweight,
      it includes some powerful features that have made VS Code one of the most popular development environment
      tools in recent times.</p>
    <p>At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a lightning fast source code editor, perfect for day-to-day use. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your code with ease.</p>

    <p>  For serious coding, you'll often benefit from tools with more code understanding than just blocks of text. Visual Studio Code includes built-in support for IntelliSense code completion, rich semantic code understanding and navigation, and code refactoring.
      
      And when the coding gets tough, the tough get debugging. Debugging is often the one feature that developers miss most in a leaner coding experience, so we made it happen. Visual Studio Code includes an interactive debugger, so you can step through source code, inspect variables, view call stacks, and execute commands in the console.
      
      VS Code also integrates with build and scripting tools to perform common tasks making everyday workflows faster. VS Code has support for Git so you can work with source control without leaving the editor including viewing pending changes diffs.
