    <p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be
       structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article
       will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions. </p> 
    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose,
       or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image 
       hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
    <p>This markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default
       characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page 
       designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
       in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
      (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
       However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the
       separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

    <P>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax
       example and also covers some key terms about the language.</P>
    <P>In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will
       look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text.
       What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no 
       explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</P>
    <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning
       a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. </p>
